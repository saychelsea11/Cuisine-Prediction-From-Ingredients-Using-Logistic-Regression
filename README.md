# Project title

*Cuisine Prediction From Ingredients Using Logistic Regression*

# Goal

- To predict the cuisines of dishes based on the ingredients. 
- The dataset consisted of a list of ingredients for each dish and the cuisine as the target variable. 

# Approach 

- Used logistic regression to predict the cuisines from the dataset of ingredients.  
- Applied text mining techniques such as regular expressions, lemmatization, count vectorizer and TFIDF to clean and prepare the data for the modeling phase.
